# workout-timer

App in vue js for android. App will show logo on top and 3 options to choose . For build power muscle or condition. You can choose one option. 

Its delays time between sets:
1. Power option has 4 minutes
2. Muscle has 1 minute
3. Condition has 30 seconds


Below we have button to start or stop counting timer.

So how it works. 
If we choose option 1 it will has delay 4 minutes. Every 4 minutes it will make sound beep that indicates start lifting set. 

So it should make another beeps when you should start workout set and other beeps when break is over.
